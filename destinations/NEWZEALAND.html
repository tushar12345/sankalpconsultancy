            <p style="text-align: justify">
            It is a well connected country with all sorts of opportunities to advance your career. Resident of New Zealand also believe, LIFE IS FOR LIVING. For the record, New Zealand was rated 6th in the world for work-life balance in HSBC's 2017 Expat Explorer survey. It has relaxed pace of life; their easy-going ways, uncrowded communities, relatively low crime rates and compact workplaces all mean life’s generally less stressed here. <br> People of New Zealand find time for life’s finer things. For example, CNN rates Wellington one of the world’s 8th great coffee cities. Smaller, less crowded cities and towns make getting to and from work much easier. Expect to leave home at a decent hour, and arrive back with time to achieve something in the evening. Though, Auckland is the exception. Like any million-plus city it has noticeable peak hour traffic congestion. They don’t have months of baking heat or intense snow: they have a temperate climate which means relatively mild, wet winters and warm dry summers. One can get easy access to travel in the Asia Pacific region. <br> Endless nature and beautiful geography – the ever changing landscape of New Zealand has captured the hearts of adventurists and artists alike: hauntingly desolate rock, jagged cliffs, bubbling rocks and wide spaces are abundant in New Zealand. While feeling safe is a luxury in many places, it’s one that New Zealanders are accustomed to. Safe and stable democratic environment. New Zealand has a fascinating political system that has achieved great results worthy of closer observation. Universities in New Zealand have a vast number of international students thereby offering the students a true international ambience. There are more than 105,000 students in New Zealand. All NZ university campuses are filled with international students from Europe, Japan, India, South America and Australia enrolled in various programs. Indian students studying in New Zealand are mostly pursuing vocational courses with private tertiary institutions (70%) and polytechnics (20%) as per the Education of New Zealand. <br> <br>
